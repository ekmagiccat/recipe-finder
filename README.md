## **Description**

This application takes user inputs for ingredients and searches for recipes that contain those ingredients. The user can specify dietary restrictions and cuisine types to further narrow their search. It will return a list of recipes that match the user's search and allow them to click on their recipe of choice to see the ingredients list and recipe instructions. If there are no recipes found with the user's chosen inputs, it will return a "No recipes match that description" message. The application also offers a light mode and dark mode for your viewing pleasure.

### Debugging

If the program does not run, try the following:

-   Check for error messages
    -   All errors will be routed to the DOM and read on the page.
    -   If 404 error:
        -   Check that the API_KEY variable in your .env file has no trailing whitespace or any punctuation. This includes no semicolon at the end of declaration.
        -   Check that your API key/access code from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty) is valid.
        -   Try generating the GET request in an API development/testing app or in your browser URL:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`https://tasty.p.rapidapi.com/recipes/list?q=`<strong>`<ingredient>`</strong>`&from=0&size=5&tags=`<strong>`<cuisine_type>`</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;headers: {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'X-RapidAPI-Key': <strong>`<your_api_key_goes_here>`</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>
        }
-   Ensure dotenv is installed
    -   In your Terminal enter `npm install dotenv-webpack@2.0.0 --save-dev`

## **Known Bugs**
-   some ingredients listed as n/a
-   wrong error message when searching a conflicting ingredient and dietary type without cuisine type (chicken, any, vegetarian)
